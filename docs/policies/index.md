# Policies and Responsible Use

JSU Research Computing resources are shared across the university community. To maintain a secure, reliable, and fair environment for all users, we publish clear policies and expectations for system use.

All users are responsible for reading and following these policies before using JSU Research Computing resources.

## Policy Areas

### Acceptable Use
Users must:
- use JSU Research Computing resources for approved academic and research purposes
- follow JSU IT acceptable use expectations
- protect access credentials (accounts must not be shared)

---

### User Expectations (Shared Systems)
To support a fair and reliable experience for all users:
- do not run computationally demanding tasks directly on login/submit nodes  
- test a small version of your workflow before submitting large job batches  
- avoid unsupervised automation on login nodes (unless approved)

---

### Data Policies
Users are expected to:
- manage data responsibly and keep copies outside the HTC system
- avoid using the system for restricted or protected data (HIPAA/PHI, FERPA, GDPR, etc.)
- follow all JSU data security expectations

> HTC storage locations should be treated as short-term storage for active computational work.

---

### Export Control
Users must comply with JSU export control expectations.  
If you are unsure whether your data, software, or research outputs fall under export control restrictions, contact the appropriate JSU office before using the system.
