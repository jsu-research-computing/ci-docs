# Support

JSU Research Computing is supported by the **Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Facilitation Team**.  
We help students, faculty, and research teams plan computing needs, learn workflows, and troubleshoot issues.

## How to Get Help

When you contact us, please include:

- Your **name** and **JSU affiliation** (student/faculty/staff + department)
- A short **project description**
- What you were trying to do (1–2 sentences)
- Any **error message/output** (copy/paste text, remove sensitive data)
- The name of any related repo/page (if applicable)

This helps us respond faster and route your request correctly.
