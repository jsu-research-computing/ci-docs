# Get Access to JSU Research Computing

Jackson State University Research Computing provides access to shared computational resources for **students, faculty, and staff** engaged in academic research, coursework, and scholarly projects.

To ensure responsible and effective use of these resources, all new users follow a structured onboarding process.

---

## Who Can Request Access

Access is available to:

- Current **JSU students, faculty, and staff**
- Student researchers with an active **faculty sponsor**
- Research teams requiring computational support for approved academic work

All users must have a valid **JSU NetID** before access can be granted.

## Access Process Overview

### 1. Submit the Research Computing Intake Form  
Provide a brief description of your project and expected computing needs, including:

- CPU or GPU requirements  
- memory and storage needs  
- expected data transfer size  
- research timeline and goals  

---

### 2. Attend an Intake Facilitation Meeting  
During this one-hour consultation, the Cyberinfrastructure Facilitation Team will:

- review your project goals  
- clarify computing and data requirements  
- recommend appropriate resources or training  
- outline next steps for onboarding  

---

### 3. Complete Required Training  
New users may be asked to complete introductory training covering:

- Linux command line basics  
- High-Throughput Computing (HTC) concepts
