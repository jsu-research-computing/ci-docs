# HTCondor Job Examples

JSU Research Computing provides ready-to-use **HTCondor example workflows** to help new users quickly learn how to run computational jobs on shared cyberinfrastructure systems.

These examples are designed to be:

- simple to understand  
- safe to run on shared resources  
- easy to modify for real research projects  

---

## Example Repository

All official JSU HTCondor examples are maintained in the public repository:

➡ **HTCondor Examples (GitHub)**  
https://github.com/jsu-research-computing/htcondor-examples

Users can download, copy, and adapt these templates for coursework, research, and experimentation.

---

## Included Workflows

The example repository currently includes:

### Hello World Job
A minimal HTCondor job demonstrating:

- basic submit file structure  
- job execution and logging  
- output file generation  

This is the recommended **first job** for all new users.

---

### File Transfer Job
Shows how to:

- send input files to compute nodes  
- retrieve output files after execution  
- manage working directories safely  

This pattern is essential for **real research workloads**.

---

### DAGMan Workflow
Demonstrates:

- multi-step job pipelines  
- dependency management between jobs  
- scalable execution of complex workflows  

This example prepares users for **advanced computational research**.

---

## How to Use These Examples

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Read the README inside each example folder.  
3. Modify file paths and resource requests for your project.  
4. Submit jobs using HTCondor on JSU systems.  

New users should complete **training modules** before running large workloads.
