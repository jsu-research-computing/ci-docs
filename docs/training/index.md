# Training for JSU Research Computing

Jackson State University provides structured training to help students, faculty, and research teams **successfully use research computing resources** and develop modern computational research skills.

These learning pathways support both **first-time users** and **advanced researchers** working with high-throughput and data-intensive workloads.

---

## Training Goals


JSU Research Computing training is designed to help users:

- understand **High-Throughput Computing (HTC)** concepts and terminology  
- build confidence using the **Linux command line**  
- create and manage **HTCondor job submissions**  
- transfer, manage, and store research data responsibly  
- develop **reproducible software environments** for research workflows  

These skills prepare researchers to work efficiently on **shared cyberinfrastructure systems** and national computing platforms.

## Core Training Modules

### Module 1 — Introduction to High-Throughput Computing
Learn how HTC enables large-scale research by running many computational jobs across distributed resources.  
Topics include HTC terminology, system architecture, and real research use cases.

---

### Module 2 — Linux and Command Line Basics
Develop essential skills for navigating file systems, editing files, managing permissions, and running scripts using the Linux terminal.

---

### Module 3 — HTCondor Job Scheduling and Execution
Understand how to:

- write submit files  
- request computing resources  
- monitor job progress  
- interpret output, error, and log files  

This module provides the foundation for running research workloads on JSU systems.

---

### Module 4 — Multiple Jobs and Data Transfer
Learn strategies for:

- submitting many jobs safely and efficiently  
- transferring input and output files  
- managing research data across computing environments  

---

### Module 5 — Software Environments and Reproducibility
Explore methods for creating consistent research environments using:

- environment modules  
- package managers (such as Conda)  
- portable software and container approaches  

Reproducible environments ensure research results remain reliable and shareable.

---

## Who Should Complete Training

Training is recommended for:

- new JSU Research Computing users  
- students beginning computational research  
- faculty integrating computing into coursework or grants  
- research teams scaling data-intensive workflows  

Some onboarding steps may **require completion of specific modules** before full system access is granted.

---

## Additional Learning Opportunities

JSU researchers may also participate in:

- national **Open Science Grid (OSG)** training sessions  
- **PATh** cyberinfrastructure workshops  
- domain-specific computational research tutorials  

These opportunities connect JSU researchers to the **broader national research computing ecosystem**.
